                Scavengers as the name suggests,<strong> Sc-Scientist Avengers</strong> is a instagram based comic
                series launched by the students of NIT Agartala, till now the comic is been released locally for the
                students of NIT and is not been promoted on a vast media.With time team is looking forward to move ahead
                with the idea of releasing the comic for everyone who is keen to look after the textbook scientists in a different look. 
                Scavengers is entirely a work of fiction and does not promote any kind of false assumption, hatred, violence etc.
